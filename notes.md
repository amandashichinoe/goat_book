## Functional Test

- **Functional Test** = **Acceptance Test** = **End-to-End Test**  
- Also known as **black box test** or **closed box test** because the test doesn't have knowledge of the internal workings of the system under test.
- It involves looking at how the application functions as a whole, from the userâ€™s perspective.

### Useful Concepts

**User Story:**  
   - A description of how the application will work from the userâ€™s point of view.
   - Used to structure the functional test.

**Expected Failure:**  
   - When a test fails in the way we expect it to.
   - This can be useful for testing failure scenarios and ensuring the application handles them correctly.
